I have one publication, that relied heavily on code in R. I named the packages and versions and had the code as supplementary material, including the raw data. This work should be highly reproducible. In other publications that involve analysis with software, we named the software including versions, specific procedure(s) and the most important parameters. This does not allow complete reproducibility, but robust results should stand if e.g. the T-test is done in R instead of SAS. A more important limitation is that we usually did not make raw data, except sequence data, available.
I don’t have enough experience, but I hope that publications developing methods for computational biology and bioinformatics, including models make their code available one way or another, because they are a major part of the results. If they don’t, the work is not reproducible. In contrast, research using published and/or commercial software should still be reproducible, even if some detail was left out. It really does not matter if data was stored in Excel, as some publications specify, or in LibreOffice’s Calc.
I have no illusion that many studies in the area of Poultry Diseases are not fully reproducible. There are so many variables, some consciously set like lightning programs or feed formulation, some just happening like weather or origin of feed ingredients, that they cannot all be named, even less reproduced.
