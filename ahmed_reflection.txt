Currently, I only store my code in the form of .history files from the projects. I dont think this would pass the reproducibility test in many circumstances. I do not indicate where files go and 
what type of file they are. This coupled with the redundancy of my code makes it tedious to store or present.
Using git looks like it would be very beneficial in that regard. 
Non-reproducible research is difficult to use as support to a claim 
because peers cannot verify its reliability. I'm studying pre-dentistry 
and I know that research needs to be reproducible in order to 
effectively treat patients. Even non-reproducible code can lead to 
mistakes in treatment plans and billing.
