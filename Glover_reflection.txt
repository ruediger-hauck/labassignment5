Currently, all the work and codes generated in my lab is maintained on Box. I think that almost everything will be reproducible in this lab because everyone in the lab can easily access all the data and codes needed. 
Non-reproducible research affects computational biology and bioinformatics because the data generated from the experiments are invalid and may not make any sense. One of the biggest things that I have learned using information and computational bio, you can make a code/script and generate data, but if the parameters you set are non existent, so is the data you think you are generating. 
In my current field of genetics, it is imperative that all the data is reproducible.
