I do not believe my current code and documents as they stand would be very reproducible, given that I typically do not "clean up" my code and provide instructions as to how to replicate that or the documents that I create. I believe that reproduciblity is the basis by which computational biology and bioinformatics are able to continue, as new and continuing studies are informed by quick and easy ways to access foundational data. In my particular field of study, reproducibility is integral to the continuation of scientific knowledge, given that faulty data does not give one a foundation to work on.
